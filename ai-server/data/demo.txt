The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair. The tower stands 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall, about the same height as an 81-story building, and was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930. Today, it is one of the most recognizable structures in the world and is a symbol of France and its capital city.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. Applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition, and machine vision. AI can be categorized as either weak or strong. Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is designed and trained for a particular task, while strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), exhibits human-like intelligence and can perform any intellectual task that a human being can
The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built as early as the 7th century BC, but the most famous and best-preserved sections were built between the 14th and 17th centuries during the Ming dynasty. The Great Wall stretches over approximately 21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles) and is one of the most impressive architectural feats in history, attracting millions of tourists from around the world each year.
